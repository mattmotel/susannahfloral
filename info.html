<h2>Hi, I&rsquo;m Susannah!&nbsp;<br/>
It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you.
</h2>
<p>
I spent the early years of my career in NYC as a project manager in the fashion industry where I could marry my love of organization and creativity. (Left brain, meet right brain.) But something always felt a little&hellip; off.
</p><p>
In 2018 I took the leap and switched things up, taking on an apprentice role at a high-end floral studio in Philadelphia. It&rsquo;s one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve ever made and soon it was easy to see that my background in event planning and design made this new direction a perfect fit.
</p><p>
Working with flowers is an honor, as you have been invited to work with people on some of the most emotional and wonderful days of their lives. First and foremost I take my inspiration from color, letting the hues of the season tell a unique story for each client.
</p><p>
My philosophy is simple: Always be excited to learn, and never stop growing.
